## Project description

Drones are now finding more and more applications and are being used in fields ranging from agriculture to surveillance, but rescue missions are usually not an easy task.

The creation of a drone that will see the distance and make a short path to a person.

Our goal is to save as many drowning people as possible and make them live longer.

The drone will be controlled by the rescuer with the help of his smartphone, with the help of the drone he will see much farther distances and react quickly.

### Project idea

The idea of our project came to us right away because many people don’t know how to swim in deep places and they are rescued by lifeguards, but there are always bad endings. Our project is to help a person with a drone as soon as possible so that he does not drown in the water.

### The potential outcomes

Imagine in the distance a person who is drowning in water in the photographs, we will make it so that we can determine how far and at what angle from the center the drone should fly. Thus, we indicate a point on the photo and at the output we get two values ​​of distance (in meters) and angle (in degrees). And thus we choose the best path to the drowning man and drop the lifebuoy.

### Using Clover platform

We would like to use Clover platform because it have camera and campanion PC.
