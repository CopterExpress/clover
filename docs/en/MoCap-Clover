# Project name

[CopterHack-2023](copterhack2023.md), team **Clover with Motion Capture System**.

## Team information

The list of team members:

* Sean Smith, @ssmith_81, engineer and developer.

## Project description

This project is an educational reference and detailed tutorial on how to setup the OptiTrack Motion Capture (MoCap) system with the COEX Clover platform. 
It gives brief descriptions on the camera and motive software setup with many resourceful links, but it assumes the user has a basic understanding on how to
setup the cameras and motive computer software. MoCap markers allow the MoCap to stream positional data of the Clover therefore marker placement is discussed. 
From there details on how to stream position data from the MoCap to the Clover along with how to configure the Clover; specifically, the Raspberry Pi and PX4 
firmware parameters are discussed. The overall network will be provided as it is the most important part.

At the end, I will provide an interesting example such as a tracking a complex trajectory that any user can implement.

### Project idea

In many research applications highly precise position feedback is required and that is why a MoCap system is popular in this field of robotics. Research papers 
are published detailed around certain topics such as control, path planning, obstacle avoidance and many more although the details surrounding certain hardware 
setups such as with the MoCap system are not provided. There are a few sources that provide help with setting up the MoCap system with PX4 and other specific 
systems but with limited knowledge of how and why steps are made one might not be able to adapt it to their own setup such as with the Clover. That is why this 
project has been created; so that a student or user can follow this tutorial with the COEX Clover and have a working setup with the MoCap and Clover even with 
a limited understanding of software and hardware. The article also provides descriptions on why certain things are done to allow the user the better understand 
the system setup.

I currently have the setup running but now working well. The Clover is unable to follow setpoints with any precision
therefore working through network and software issues seems to be the current stage (I am not sure what exactly is causing this issue actually). I am hoping to 
receive guidance in this area from this project so I can have it working as desired.

### Using Clover platform

The COEX Clover 4.2 kit is used where the MoCap system setup is specific for the Clover platform. It provides useful information for all robotics users interested in 
implementing external sensor feedback although it is specific for Clover owners.

### Additional information at the request of participants
I am a masters student looking to implement this project in my research.
