# Power setup

Open the *Vehicle Setup* tab and select the *Power* menu.

## Calibrating the power sensor

> **Note** Power sensor calibration should be done with the battery pack connected to the drone.

1. In QGroundControl software, go the *Vehicle Setup* panel and choose the *Power* menu.
2. Set the *Number of cells* parameter according to the number of cells in your battery (*3* for the Clover 4 drone).
3. Calculate the voltage divider:
    * Measure voltage across the battery (you may use a battery voltage tester for that).
    * Press the *Calculate* button next to the *Voltage divider* label.
    * Put the battery voltage into the prompt and click *Calculate*.
    * Press *Close* to save the calculated value.

If there is no voltage indicator or manual calibration is not possible, set the average value of the voltage divider for the Clover 4 kit (*Voltage divider* = 11).

## ESC calibration

> **Warning** **Never attempt ESC calibration with propellers on!** In some cases the motors will start spinning with maximum speed.

1. Make sure the battery is disconnected and the propellers are not mounted.
2. Press *Calibrate*.
3. Connect the battery when prompted.
4. Wait for the *Calibration complete*.
