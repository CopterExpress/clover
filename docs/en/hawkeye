## Project description
Logistics and surveillance of remote and inaccessible places, in order to avail medical and essential
food supplies

### Project idea
UAV Based delivery:
Planning and optimizing flight plan for the UAV to deliver payload in order the UAV would use an on board processor for facial
recognition to verify the customer's identity from the database, post which payload would be unlocked.
Briefly describe the idea and stage of the project. We alson plan on intergrating the whole system with QR code for simplification
of delivery mechanism.

●Add/Remove/Update location of a waypoint mid flight simulation
●Plan and optimise an automated flight path
●Run simulations on Gazebo with compliance with ROS
●Comply facial and gesture recognition used to verify and ease delivery acceptance proces

### The potential outcomes
●Disaster Management
● Remote Location
● Supply
● Incidents
●Disaster Relief
● Delivery of medicines
● delivery of food
● rescue
