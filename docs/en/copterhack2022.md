CopterHack 2022 is an international open-source projects competition on aerial robotics. The mainstream of the CopterHack 2022 is team competition with a free choice of the project topic. In addition, this year we organized a second category, company cases. The competition’s main language is English.

You can see the articles of the CopterHack 2021 finalist teams by the link [CopterHack 2021](copterhack2021.md).

The proposed projects have to be open-source and be compatible with the Clover quadcopter platform. Teams will work on their projects throughout the competition, bringing them closer to the state of the finished product. Industry experts will assist the participants through lectures and regular feedback.

## Company case competition

Teams are welcome to dive into the development of the following company cases:

The list of cases may be expanded in future.
