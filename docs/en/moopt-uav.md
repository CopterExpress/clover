## Project description

### Project idea

Pesticide spraying requires multi-UAVs to do blanket spraying on multiple farmlands. Such tasks not only need to ensure that all crops in the farmland are sprayed but also need to assign a specific task sequence and flight trajectory for each UAV in order for them to fly between multiple farmlands.

We would like to build a model to assign the UAVs to multiple candidate farmlands for maximizing pesticides spraying effect based on the fuel limitation, flight trajectory, temperature, spraying order, spraying method, time windows, distance between farmlands, ... etc.

### The potential outcomes

Assigning the UAVs to multiple candidate farmlands for maximizing pesticides spraying effect.

### Using Clover platform

Clover will be used as a platform for generating time windows and routing paths dynamically according to the temperature and other variables.

### Additional information at the request of participants

We help smaller Critical Industries to build a custom industrial automation system 200x faster, with 1000+ pre-built templates based on our 10 years experience in supply chain management.
