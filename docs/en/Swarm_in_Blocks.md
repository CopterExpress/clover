## Project description

### Project idea

Develop a platform that facilitates the use and learning of drone swarm implementation through the use of block programming, focusing on the Clover quadcopter. The project will provide:

- Expand Clover features and applications;
- Improve and simplify communication between the swarm and the user;
- Secure the environment through pre-implemented swarm orientation algorithms;
- Implement other standard Clover functions on the platform.

### The potential outcomes

The Swarm in Blocks has several potential outcomes due to its flexibility and simplicity, being capable of adapting for the user needs. Among the main applications of the project are:

- Educational field: with the possibility of arousing curiosity and making it possible for even children to interact with the programming of the swarm, thanks to the intuitive and easy to use interface through block programming;
- Commercial field: another possible implementation for the project is forming figures in-air, thanks to the Clover’s structural features, like the LEDs. Besides attracting children’s interest in the educational field, this has a great commercial potential, becoming possible the use in events and shows;
- Security field: with the possibility of data transmission from several drones to a server, allowing the user to create applications for security systems, such as monitoring/mapping;

Additionally, the project can be used for other user-desired swarm applications, thanks to the general-purpose platform that will be developed.

### Using Clover platform

The integration with Clover platform might be simple and fully intuitive. The main aspects of Clover that we will work are block programming, simulation and real world application. The coding, simulation and real drone deploying cycle is very useful for development and learning and will be important for decision making. 

The purpose of block programming is to facilitate the development of Clover swarm applications and to be user-friendly. The tool for block programming is not defined yet because we intend to apply more studies on this topic. Essentially, it means having blocks for Clover built-in functions. Furthermore the functions that we will develop for swarm management could also be applied in blocks.

The developed algorithms will be simulated through the Clover implementation in Gazebo. One of the advantages is the fidelity to the real Clover, by the PX4 flight controller simulation, which uses the MAVROS interface for the MAVLINK protocol. The intention is to allow the planning and simulation of the mission, enabling a better organization of the swarm and the previous analysis of failures.

Finally, the application of developed and tested codes in the simulation must be minimally modified for the application in the real Clover. This concept is already used by Clover with MAVROS communication with the controller or with a base. Thus, this connection can be extended with the study of networks that allow the connection of multiple drones with a base and with each other, enabling more robust organizations methods.

### Additional information at the request of participants

The SEMEAR Group (Solutions in Mechatronics Engineering and Application in Robotics) is a non-profit group organized by students from the University of São Paulo (USP), on the São Carlos campus. The group has more than 100 members, including undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to the support of professors advisors. Its objective is to complete the academic and professional training of its members, in addition to generating and sharing knowledge with its teaching and extension programs, development of technological projects and participation in robotics competitions.
