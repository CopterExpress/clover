# IoT Water Monitoring & Optimization 

[CopterHack-2022](copterhack2022.md), team **Moopt**.

## Team information

The list of team members:

* Kai Chew, @kafechew, kafechew@moopt.com, operational researcher.
* Yee Mun, yeemun@moopt.com, data engineer.

## Project description

### Project idea

Manual labor and monitoring on water quality affected the mortality of the fishes.

Autonomously assigning the UAVs to multiple fish ponds for water quality monitoring and optimal predictive maintenance scheduling.

### The potential outcomes

Build a smart fish pond monitoring system to produce good quality fish and aquatic plants.

### Using Clover platform

Clover will be used at the predetermined sampling points, with custom multiprobes, to measure the tempreature, carbon dioxide, ammonia, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH of water. 

### Additional information at the request of participants

We help smaller Critical Industries to build a custom industrial automation system 200x faster, with 1000+ pre-built templates based on our 10 years experience in supply chain management.
