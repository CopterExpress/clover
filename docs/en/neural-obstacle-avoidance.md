# Neural obstacle avoidance

[CopterHack-2022](copterhack2022.md), team **Stereo**.

## Team information

The list of team members:

* Denis Konstantinov, @den_konstantinov, engineer and developer.

## Project description

### Project idea

Design an obstacle avoidance system using artificial potential fields method.

### The potential outcomes

A copter which can fly through regions with obstacles with a speed of at least 10 km/h and success rate of at least 95%. In real world, such solution can be used in search-and-rescue mission (might be useful for famous Russian LizaAlert).

### Using Clover platform

Clover will be used as a platform for obstacle avoidance algorithm deployment. We also plan to install a stereo camera on the Clover as the algorithm requires some source of 3D information about the surroundings.
