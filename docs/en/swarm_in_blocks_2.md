## Project description

Last year, we worked on CopterHack 2022 to build the Swarm in Blocks platform, a clover-based application which allows the user to program autonomous clovers swarms as easily as assembling little programming blocks! Because that's exactly what it takes to fly several clovers in formations using our platform. However, our project was kept on a simulated environment on the last competition, since we didn't have real clovers to make them fly on real life.
So, on this year's CopterHack, we want to explore our project on the real life, pushing it as far as we can to facilitate the creation of swarms by applying our platform on real life situations, also improving and integrating with other platforms, thus creating more features to make it more robust and safe.

### Project idea

Our plan to this year's CopterHack is to apply our platform on real-based situations using Clover's outdoor & indoor navigation. For that, we're looking foward to test methods of visual odometry (for indoor flights, where the GPS does not come in handy), but also several drones with GPS (for outdoor).
We also plan on building more features for our application, such as developing a collision avoidance system to ensure each drone's integrity and working on the user safety when it comes to using our application outside of the simulation environment. We will do this by creating means of visualizing each Clover's position, battery and flight state, making it so that if one slips out of the safe area previously programmed by the UI, it will immediatly land, avoiding problems with wandering drones.

### The potential outcomes

Our goal is to expand the drone swarm application by facilitating its architecture, since it's still quite complex to formulate drone swarms nowdays. It can be used to a large range of applications, like surveillance, rescuing, agriculture work, fire fighting and more.

### Using Clover platform

As previously mentioned, we'll keep on the work of last year CopterHack (2022) by enabling our Swarm in Blocks platform to real-life use, which is built on the Clover platform, since it has already the necessary architecture to easily control drones, especially with the simple_offboard module.

### Additional information at the request of participants

We are part of [SEMEAR](http://www.semear.eesc.usp.br/) group, from University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil. We're a team of undergraduate engineers focusing on expanding our knowledge in the robotics field by appling to competitions that challenge the group. We took 1st place in the CopterHack 2022 competition.
