Nowadays, swarm of drones are getting more and more applications and being used in several different areas, since agriculture to surveillance and rescues, but controlling a high amount of drones usually isn't a simple task, demanding a lot of studies and a complex software. Swarm in Blocks was born looking to make a high-level interface based on the blocks language, to make simple handling swarms, without requiring advanced knowledge in all the necessary platforms, creating tools to allow a lot of applications based on the user needs and also using the Clover platform, which has a lot of advantages as being complete and intuitive, supporting all the project goals.
