# Swarm-in-blocks

**V√çDEO**

## Introduction

Nowadays, swarm of drones are getting more and more applications and being used in several different areas, since agriculture to surveillance and rescues, but controlling a high amount of drones usually isn't a simple task, demanding a lot of studies and a complex software. Swarm in Blocks was born looking to make a high-level interface based on the blocks language, to make simple handling swarms, without requiring advanced knowledge in all the necessary platforms, creating tools to allow a lot of applications based on the user needs and also using the Clover platform, which has a lot of advantages as being complete and intuitive, supporting all the project goals. 

## Usability
### How it works

The Swarm in Blocks can be programmed either with the blocks interface or directly in Python and we developed three main launch modes, each one focused on a different application of the project, they are:
- **Planning Mode:** Its main goal is allowing the user to check the drones' layout, save and load formations, before starting the simulator or using real clovers. In order to need less computational power and avoid possible errors during the simulation.
- **Simulation Mode:** In this mode happens the simulation indeed, starting the Gazebo, the necessary ROS nodes and some other tools. It allows applying the developed features, which will be explained ahead and see how they would behavior in real life.
- **Navigation Mode:** The last mode will support execute everything developed in real clovers, so that it's possible to control a swarm with block programming. The biggest obstacle yet is the practical testing of this mode, due to the financial difficulty of acquiring a Clover swarm.

### Web Interface

The entire Swarm in Blocks project was designed so that the user was in an intuitive and comfortable environment within the manipulation of swarms, for this, the existing platform with clover packages was completely rethought and adapted. In our [gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/s/C9O11TiXK1JPnlrpilLg/usability/blocks-api), we have more details of the front-end design, how the user can interact with it and achieve our main goal: Programming in blocks.
