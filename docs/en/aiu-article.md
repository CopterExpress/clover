## Project description

Clover AI Flight analyzer

### Project idea

A few drone owners analyze flight logs after crash, because you should know much about drone and flight charecteristics (for instance https://review.px4.io/). Also sometimes logs are being crashed themselves. In order to provide human readable log resume, we want to create a AI based flight log analyzer. Which will try to explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

### The potential outcomes

A working AI framework at backend and a friendly web-based interface at front-end to analyze flight logs.

### Using Clover platform

Since Clover platform already has a companion PC - RPi 4 it fits best for those purposes.
