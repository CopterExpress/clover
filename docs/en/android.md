# An Android transmitter

As early as in the frosty January 2018, all owners of Apple mobile devices got a nice Wi-Fi piloting app for iOS. And now, a year later, such an application is available for another operating system. The latest version may be downloaded [**here**](https://vk.com/away.php?to=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dexpress.copter.cleverrc&cc_key=).

## Introduction

In this article, I will tell you how to write your own or modify an existing transmitter for Android yourself. We will use the popular language *Kotlin*, and we will use *Android Studio* for an IDE. For those who never used it, I recommend reading the following [*materials*](https://www.google.com/search?ei=xQxDXMH0C8OOmgW4mYigDQ&q=%D0%A7%D1%82%D0%BE+%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C+%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8+%D1%8F+%D0%BD%D0%B5+%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%8E+%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%B4%3F&oq=%D0%A7%D1%82%D0%BE+%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C+%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8+%D1%8F+%D0%BD%D0%B5+%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%8E+%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%B4%3F&gs_l=psy-ab.3...4413.17423..17726...9.0..2.442.4577.45j5j1j0j1....2..0....1..gws-wiz.....6..0i71j35i39j0i131j0j0i67j0i131i67j0i22i30j33i22i29i30j33i21j33i160.0bZz-WGxoHY). The entire application code can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Tennessium/android). If you want to immediately get an app to further tuning, run the following command:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Tennessium/android
```

However, to make you fully understand the application, I will tell you about each stage of the project, as if you were building it from scratch.

## Wrapper

Let's start with the simplest thing â€” the appearance of our application. At [**GitHub**](https://github.com/CopterExpress/clover/tree/master/apps/android/app/src/main/assets), you can find *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript* files, which make up the web page to be used for controlling the copter. To have this page displayed in our application, do the following:

1. Create folder **assets** in the main folder of the app named **app**

2. Add to it all files from [here](https://github.com/CopterExpress/clover/tree/master/apps/android/app/src/main/assets)

If you reached this stage, you already have the web page you want, congratulations! Now we have to display it somehow in the app. To do this, in class *activity* in method **onCreate**, write the following code:

```Kotlin
main_web.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/index.html")
```

Where *main_web* is the ID of your *WebView*, which is in the *xml* file of the *activity* selected by you.

Unfortunately, the quadcopter transmitter requires the entire screen of the device, while the interface elements of the system interfere with full-fledged use of the program. For this purpose, at the beginning of method **onCreate**, call the following function:

```Kotlin
private fun fullScreenCall() {
	window.setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN)
	if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 19) {
		val v = this.window.decorView
		v.systemUiVisibility = View.GONE
	} else {
		//for higher API versions.
		val decorView = window.decorView
		val uiOptions = View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION or View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY
		decorView.systemUiVisibility = uiOptions
	}
}
```

This feature allows getting rid of the system interface elements. Let's go ahead.

This is how the transmitter looks at this stage:

<img src="../assets/IMG_4397.png" width="50%">

If you run your application, you will see that the sticks are not functioning. This is due to the fact that *JavaScript* is disabled in our page. To enable it, write the following code:

```Kotlin
	main_web.settings.apply {
	domStorageEnabled = true
	javaScriptEnabled = true
	loadWithOverviewMode = true
	useWideViewPort = true
	setSupportZoom(false)
}
```

This piece of code allows the page to use *JavaScript* and at the same time prepares for the next stage - **logics**.

## Receiving data from the web page

To let your phone receive data from the *HTML page*, create a class for interacting with the web interface

```Kotlin
class WebAppInterface(c: Context) {
	@JavascriptInterface
	public fun postMessage(message: String) {
		val data = JSONObject(message)
		send("255.255.255.255", 35602, pack(
		data.getInt("x").toShort(),
		data.getInt("y").toShort(),
		data.getInt("z").toShort(),
		data.getInt("r").toShort()))
	}
}
```

This class will receive messages from the web page sent by the *postMessage* where argument *message* is the message from the page.

Now we have to link classes **WebAppInterface** and **MainActivity**. For this you have to add just one line to method **onCreate**:

```Kotlin
main_web.addJavascriptInterface(WebAppInterface(this), "appInterface")
```

## Sending data to the copter

**Important!**
For working in Internet in the *Android* platform, add the following line to tag *manifest* in file **AndroidManifest.xml**:

```XML
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

It will grant your application access to the Internet, and the ability to send data via **Wi-Fi**. And you will now learn how to do that. Let's go ahead.

You have probably noticed function *send* in class **WebAppInterface**. It is this function that sends data to the copter. Let's declare it **outside classes**:

```Kotlin
fun send(host: String, port: Int, data: ByteArray, senderPort: Int = 0): Boolean {
	var ret = false
	var socket: DatagramSocket? = null
	try {
		socket = DatagramSocket(senderPort)
		val address = InetAddress.getByName(host)
		val packet = DatagramPacket(data, data.size, address, port)
		socket.send(packet)
		ret = true
	} catch (e: Exception) {
		e.printStackTrace()
	} finally {
		socket?.close()
	}
	return ret
}
```

This function sends data via the [*user datagram protocol*](https://www.google.com/search?q=udp+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB&oq=udp+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j35i39j0l3.1434j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to the copter. The program sends **bytes**, so it would be a good idea to declare the function for creating an array of **bytes** from four variables:

```Kotlin
fun pack(x: Short, y: Short, z: Short, r: Short): ByteArray {
	val pump_on_buf: ByteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(8)
	pump_on_buf.putShort(r)
	pump_on_buf.putShort(z)
	pump_on_buf.putShort(y)
	pump_on_buf.putShort(x)
	return pump_on_buf.array().reversedArray()
}
```

## Summary

Now your app has the full functionality of its analog for **iOS**. You can customize it as you wish. For any questions about the app, contact us in Telegram @Tenessinum.
