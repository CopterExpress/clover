Before connecting and calibrating the RC, make sure that:

* There is no battery connected to the drone.
* The propellers are not mounted.

## Connecting the RC transmitter

1. In QGroundControl software, go the *Vehicle Setup* panel and choose the *Radio* menu.
2. Power on the transmitter by sliding the **POWER** slider up.
3. Make sure the transmitter-receiver link is working.

    The transmitter LCD screen should display the connection:

    The LED on the receiver should glow steadily. Read the [radio troubleshooting article](radioerrors.md) if the link does not work.

## Transmitter calibration

1. Press the *Calibrate* button.
2. Set the *Throttle*, *Yaw*, *Pitch*, and *Roll* trims to 0
    * Trims are small constant offsets applied to a control in order to make your drone fly correctly.
    * Move the trimming slider to the center using trimming buttons until you hear a long beep. Do this for each axis.
3. Press *OK* in QGroundControl.
