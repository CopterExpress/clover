## Packages publishing

You can make a Pull Request in a [git repository with packages](https://github.com/CopterExpress/packages), adding or updating your package (a file with `.deb` extension), that relates to Clover or ROS. After merging your package will be available for installation with `apt` utility:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-clover-some-feature
```

Packages, that extend Clover functionality are recommended to be named with `clover_` prefix, e. g. `clover_some_feature`.

```bash
wget -O - 'http://packages.coex.tech/key.asc' | apt-key add -
echo 'deb http://packages.coex.tech buster main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update
```
