## Assembly order

### Installation of motors

* Unpack the motors. Using pliers, shorten the wires on the motors by cutting half their length (leaving about 25 mm).

![brrc2205 motor](../assets/brrc2205.png)

Strip

* remove 2 mm of insulation from the ends of the wire without damaging the copper strands.

Twist the wires.

Tin wires

* Apply flux to the exposed part of the wire.
* Cover the solder using tweezers.

![Tinning](../assets/zap.jpg)

#### Fix the motor on the mount

* Install the motor on the engraved side of the mount.
* Attach the motors to the mounts with M3x8 screws using a screwdriver.

![Fix the motor on the mount](../assets/brrc2205on.jpg)

* Mounts with motors should be arranged according to the diagram. The arrows indicate the direction of motor rotation direction.

![Rotation of motors](../assets/brrc2205ondeck.jpg)

### Tin three contact pads of the speed controller

* Apply flux
* Apply solder

By warming up the contact pads of the controller, the tin will evenly fill the entire pad. To do so, apply heat by holding the soldering iron on the contact pads for 2 sencods (or more if needed).

![Tinning of the controller contact pads](../assets/escDYSzap.png)

* Repeat this operation for the remaining three ESC

### Solder the wires of the motors to the ESC

Solder the prepared wires of the motors to the pads of the controllers.

![Solder wires of motors to the controllers](../assets/solderingBrrc2205ondeckTOescDYSzap.png)

* Repeat this operation for the remaining three ESC

### Power connectors installation

#### Preparing wires for XT60 power connectors

1. Take a bundle of red and black wires marked 14AWG
2. Cut 4 pieces of wire of the following lengths

* Length 7 cm (XT60 pin power connector) - 1 red, 1 black
* Length 9 cm (XT60 socket power connector) - 1 red, 1 black

![Preparing wires for the power connector](../assets/en/cutwire14AWG.jpg)

#### Preparing XT60 pin and XT60 socket high-power connectors

[Article about high-power connectors and their designations](connectortypes.md)

![XT60 high-power connector](../assets/xt60pinsocket.jpg)

1. Tin two red and black 14AWG 7 cm long power wires for the XT60 pin connector.
2. Tin contact pads of the XT60 pin connector.
3. Solder the black wire to the “-” contact of the connector.
4. Solder the red wire to the “+” contact of the connector.
5. Cut ⌀5 heat-shrink tubing (2 sections × 10 mm).
6. Slip the ⌀5 heat-shrink tubing tube on the wires so that they cover the contact pads of the wires from XT60.
7. Shrink the heat-shrink tubing with a hot air gun. ![Installation of XT60 connectors](../assets/mountxt60pinsocket.png)
8. Repeat the procedure for XT60 socket connector.

#### Preparation of the 5V power connectors for the control circuit

1. Trim/pull out all pins from one of the connectors. Disconnect it.
2. Using an utility knife, pry the retainer off on the remaining connector to release the 3rd wire.
3. Remove the 3rd (orange) wire from the connector, since it is not needed.
4. The length of the remaining black and red wires should be of 10 – 12 cm.

![Installation of the 5V connector](../assets/en/mount5vconnector.jpg)

### Installation of the power distribution board

#### Pre-soldering check

[Article about continuity test](test_connection.md)

![ Pre-soldering check](../assets/startPDBtest.jpg)

Check OPEN CONDITION of the following circuits (the multimeter does not beep):

* “BAT+” and “BAT-”
* “12V” and “GND”
* “5V” and “GND”

Check CLOSED CONDITION of the following circuits (the multimeter beeps):

* “BAT-” with every contact marked “-” and “GND”
* “BAT+”, with every contact marked “+”

### Tin the contact pads of the power board

1. [Tin*](tinning.md) the contact pads of the power board.
2. Using a multimeter, check absence of short-circuits on the PCB (check continuity).

![ After-soldering check](../assets/en/zapPDBtest.jpg)

By warming up the contact pads of the controller, the tin will evenly fill the entire pad. To do so, apply heat by holding the soldering iron on the contact pads for 2 sencods (or more if needed).

#### Soldering the XT60 high power connector

Solder the connector for battery, taking into account the polarity on the contact pads.

![Soldering of XT60 to PDB](../assets/solderingxt60socketTOpdb.jpg)

IMPORTANT NOTE about polarity

* the red wire is “+”
* the black wire is “-”

#### Soldering of the power connector for the 5V control circuit

Solder the 5V connector, taking into account the polarity on the contact pads.
(in the picture: the red wire is “+”)

![Soldering of 5V to PDB](../assets/solderingxt60socketTOpdb.jpg)

### Installation of the battery compartment

#### Preparation of jumpers (3 pcs.)

![Jumper](../assets/jumper.png)

* Cut off 2 cm of high-power wire.
* Strip on both ends.
* Tin.
* Make 3 jumpers.
* Solder the jumpers according to the diagram.
* Check for continuity with a multimeter. If necessary, clean with sand paper.

#### Preparation of the battery compartment

![Preparation of the battery compartment](../assets/casebattery.png)

## Safety notes for assembly and configuration

1. Remove the propellers.“All ground operations are to be performed with propellers removed. Propellers are to be installed on the motors before the flight only.”
2. Disconnect the battery. Keep the power off. “Assembly, configuration, and maintenance should be performed with power disconnected. Connect power only for testing electronic components of the drone. After testing, power is to be disconnected before other works.”
3. Call for help. “If you experience problem when working with the drone, contact the instructor or the teacher, do not try to solve the problem yourself.”

![Safety during assembly](../assets/safetybyassem.png)

## Security when working with 18650 Li-ion batteries

1. Handle batteries carefully. Avoid falls, bumps, and deformations.
2. When connecting (disconnecting) batteries, hold only the connectors, never pull or tug the wires.
3. If you see open connectors, violation of insulation or battery compartment integrity, do not touch it, and immediately inform the instructor or teacher.
