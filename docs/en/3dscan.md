# 3D-scanning drone

<img src="../assets/3d_drone_1.jpg" title="3D-scanning drone" height=500px>

The project was created in collaboration with Texel inc. that develops 3D-scanners for scanning people.

Our fellows from Texel provided a module consisting of a Raspberry Pi and a PrimeSense 3D-sensor.

We provided a Clever 3 drone that's capable of autonomous flight and wrote a flight program.

To make it all work we conducted many tests, made changes in the drone's design and tuned the drone properly.
